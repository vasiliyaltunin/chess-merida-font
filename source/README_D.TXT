                         TrueType Font CHESS MERIDA
                          Update: August 12, 1998.

The figures of this font follow the more traditional style  of  the  figures
found in many publications with chess diagrams. I took them from a book with
more than 5,000 chess problems.

        I have given it the name of MERIDA in honor of a city in the
        Yucatan Peninsula, in the south east of  Mexico,  where  the
        International Grand Master  Carlos Torre Repetto (1904-1978)
        was born. He beat F. Marshall,  E. Lasker  and  E. Grnfeld,
        among other players of  the  same  category.  Currently  the
        city of Merida is the seat of one of  the  most  outstanding
        chess tournaments of Mexico, the "Carlos Torre".

The figurines was created in Corel Draw 3.0 and exported to  TTF  format  in
Corel Draw 7.0.  I made the font in the  "Colegio La Salle de San Cristobal"
(La Salle School of San Cristobal), located in the pleasant mountains of the
south of Mexico; in order to expand our collection of chess fonts.  The font
is freeware, I hope it is useful for the chess buddies. If you want to repay
us, you can send us some other fonts for  creating  chess  diagrams  (we are
collecting them).  Your comments and suggestions would  be  welcome;  please
send them to either of address that appear below.

         CHESMERI.DOC     Sample and keymap.

The font is installed in Windows, as in any  other  TTF  font.  It  will  be
helpful to you for making chess diagrams and figurine notation in  the  word
processors  which  are  run  under  Windows.  The  file  CHESMERI.DOC  which
accompanies this file is made on  Word 6.0,  and contains a  sample  of  the 
creation of diagrams in a word proccesor and a keymap of this font. You will
not see these characters until the 'Chess Merida' font is installed in  your
computer.  The distribution of the figures on the keyboard is the same as in
the CHESS MARROQUIN font, as follows:

* The EXTRA keys contain round corners.  The keys  (x),  (X),  (.), and  (:)
  contain auxiliary symbols to indicate individual movements of the  pieces.

NOTE: Also you find borders with the coordinates of chessboard.  For  simple
      borders, type the ASCII codes  from  0192  to  0207,  and  for  double
      borders from 0224 to 0239.  Don't forget to type [Alt]  and  the  ZERO
      which goes with each code to generate these characters. 
      
      The figurine notation pieces are in the ASCII codes from 0162 to 0167.

      I recommend you to print the .DOC file and see the complete keymap.
